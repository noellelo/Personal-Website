# Personal-Website

This is a simple, static personal portfolio site I built using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a clean and responsive digital homepage showcasing my background, projects, and contact info.

Though minimal in tech stack, this site helped me solidify foundational front-end skills such as layout design, semantic HTML, and visual hierarchy. It also marked the beginning of my journey into full-stack development.

ðŸ‘‰ This site is a learning project and will evolve as I adopt frameworks like React and Tailwind.
